# BigQuery Tutorial

## Exploring an Ecommerce Dataset using SQL in Google BigQuery

### Overview
BigQuery is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database. With BigQuery we can query terabytes and terabytes of data without having any infrastructure to manage or needing a database administrator. BigQuery uses SQL and can take advantage of the pay-as-you-go model. BigQuery allows we to focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights.

We have a newly available ecommerce dataset that has millions of Google Analytics records for the Google Merchandise Store loaded into a table in BigQuery. In this notebook, we use a copy of that dataset. Sample scenarios are provided, from which we look at the data and ways to remove duplicate information.
